# Forecast of online retail sells


The objective of this repository is to do some EDA and forecast of retail sells.


The dataset used is from: <https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Retail#>
It is a transnational data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail.The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers. Given this retailerâ€™s 2010-2011 transactions in the datatest, the objective is to predict the amount this retailer will sell each day of 2012.


The EDA and forecast attempts are saved in the final_models.ipynb which is a Python notebook. The dataset is in the data folder and the final predictions are in the predictions.csv file.
